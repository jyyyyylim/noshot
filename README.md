# noshot
removes the youtube shorts UI, once and for all
<br>piss simple userscript

### effects:
forces youtube shorts to default to the default video UI, returning video functionality<br>
in effect, retains the browsing and viewing of shorts without compromising with shitty UI

### installation:
just [add this to your userscript engine](../../raw/main/noshort.user.js)


### raison detre:
shorts ui makes zero sense both as a concept and in implementation<br>
