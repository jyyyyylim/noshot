# noshot
effectively disables the youtube shorts UI, once and for all
<br>piss simple userscript

### effects:
forces youtube shorts to default to the default video UI, returning normal video functionality<br>
in effect, forces feature parity between shorts/videos, bypassing the handicaps youtube puts on shorts

### installation:
just [add this to your userscript engine](../../raw/main/noshort.user.js)


### raison detre:
shorts ui makes zero sense both as a concept and in implementation<br>

### todo:
fix script not working when short is opened in current tab instead of a new tab (24/3)
